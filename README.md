# Google-Maps
Pulling information from google maps

Update: Now complete!

A pretty useless but quite fun project.

Find out how to get google map json files here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRD8s9cyp44
Store all the .json files in the same folder to get it to work

This program takes map history data from Google Takeout and reads the json files. It grabs the address of the place you went to and requests the name of the location from google maps. For now, prints it out onto your command line.

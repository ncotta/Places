# Oh The Places You'll Go!
Pulling information from google maps
This is a continuation of a project I worked on some time ago. It is basically a wishlist of places you want to go.

Find out how to get google map json files here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRD8s9cyp44
Store all the .json files in the same folder to get it to work

This program takes map history data from Google Takeout and reads the json files. It grabs the address of the place you went to and requests the name of the location from google maps. For now, prints it out onto your command line.

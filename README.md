# Google-Maps
Pulling information from google maps

Update: Now complete!

A pretty useless but quite fun project.

This program takes map history data from Google Takeout and reads the json files. It grabs the address of the place you went to and requests the name of the location from google maps. For now, prints it out onto your command line.
